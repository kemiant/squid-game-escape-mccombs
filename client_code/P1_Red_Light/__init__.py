Right now, Player 48 is in the "Red Light, Green Light" stage, where every movement counts. As they inch their way forward, you need to extract a critical password that will give you access to the mainframe and help them proceed in the future games.

Your Mission:

Locate the Password: The password is buried deep within the system, hidden in the data stream. Extract the critical information before the doll turns around.
Maintain Stealth: The giant doll monitors every movement. Stay still whenever you hear music playing. Failing to do so will expose your connection.
Hack the Mainframe: Use the password to unlock the database. Once you’re in, you’ll have access to vital information for the next games.
Time is of the essence. The guards are watching, and the doll could turn around at any moment. Stay vigilant.

Embark on this journey with precision and stealth. Success means survival, Player 136.

Click the button below to get hacking and stay alive!
